# Game Time Project: Snake on a Plane

[Play the game] (https://kccrs.github.io/Snakes)

## Description

Snake on a Plane was built in Javascript and HTML5 canvas and also used some CSS3.. This game was built by Casey Cross and Paul Nguyen as a paired project in Module 1 of the Turing School's Front-End Engineering program.

The goal of this project was to use all the skills we've learned so far to build a simple game that was playable and looked good in the browser.

We used the classic snake game and the terrible movie "Snakes on a Plane" as inspiration to create Snake on a Plane. Players maneuver a snake on the canvas and attempt to eat pieces of food that randomly appear.  When the snake eats food, it grows longer.  The snake dies and the game ends if the snake runs into a wall or itself.

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```  

## Insight
We decided to build a variation of the class snake game to stretch our Javascript and HTML5 Canvas abilities and better understand unit testing.
